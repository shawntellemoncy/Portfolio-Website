			<p>My name is Shawntelle Marie Moncy and I am a journalism student at <a href="http://ewu.edu">Eastern Washington University</a>. I chose the major journalism because I love to write, writing is like an art to me and I love to portray my style and personality through my writing. 
			My goal through life is to continually impress others and continually impress myself.</p>

			<p>After graduation I would either like to join the Peace Corp and then go to graduate school for broadcasting in New York, where I&rsquo;d like to live in the future. Or just go straight to graduate school.
		Why broadcasting? My favorite part of journalism through my experiences in classes here at Eastern and on &ldquo;The Easterner&rdquo; student newspaper, is although I love to write, my favorite part is simply interviewing and communicating with my interviewees. I like to make people feel comfortable and make sure that their even having fun talking to me. I&rsquo;ve realized that that&rsquo;s not how an interview is supposed to go in the newspaper world, so I&rsquo;m having to hold back that temptation in the mean time. But in broadcast, I get to do just that! I would love to do live interviews or talk about subjects with other news peers and have fun with it!
		To work for &ldquo;The Daily Show&rdquo;, &ldquo;Evening Magazine&rdquo; or something of that sort would be a dream job to me.</p>
